# Arduino
## to do
* add actual switch commands

## Investigate
* read supply voltage possible
* is there a way to disable WIFI in software?
* use byte characteristic: each light one bit so multiple switching is possible

## Improvements
* use IMU for alarm
* use IMU for brake lights

# Android
* check existing BLE CSC apps (cateye)
* web app for android
